To approach this project it is very important to start from a practical 
view point - why?

1. Given the scope of the project, it is very easy to get lost.
2. I am not a hardware or a verilog designer - hence, there is a high
chance I might end up doing a lot of work  that is not my area and
will require a lot of time. 
3. RISC-V implementations from blue spec seems like a good option
	- despite being low performance, it gives us a good place to start from
	- we can later move on to other designs from bluespec (?) 
4.
