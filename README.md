# Different Layers from ISA to Hardware


Goals:
1. Understanding the different layers
2. Understanding the different categories of instructions - such as floating points, memory management instructions etc. 
3. Designing semantics to find the relations between the isa and the hardware (or system) level architecture
4. Understanding the scope of the project

Some questions right now?
1. ACL2 vs Sail vs Coq and blah blah?
2. How does concurrent execution and caches fit in the layers? - very hand wavy understanding as of now (10th march'20)



- Category wise different papers in the area
- Resources and links in the ResourceLR to the recent work that has been done in the area
- General Insights - Insights in the area and some important things to remember


ISA                                               
- Instructions  
- Memory model (for consistency) - general rules (not hardware specific)
- 


System level architecture
- Micro ops
- Actual concurrent execution - implementation layer
- Caches (?)
- Hardware interrupts 
- Memory management (la la)


TBA: Selecting the chunks out of these and why? - la la la
